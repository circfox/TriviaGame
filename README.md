# TriviaGame
This is the basic version of the TriviaGame assignment. I used the theme from the movie The Matrix and titled my homework as JS !Trivia Reloaded. JS for Javascript and ! means the js questions are not really trivial. The background which is a generic presentation of the matrix rain code. I did not write the code for that but borrowed it from some public website. There are 6 questions to be answered in a time limit of 20 sec. The timer starts when the header is clicked and is displayed at the bottom center of the header. After time is up the score shows at the upper left of the header. The number of unanswered questions shows to the right. The submit button disappears after time is up or when it is pressed.
